      <h2 class="mitte">Stoicism</h2>
      <p class="justify">
        Stoicism is a philosophy of life that maximizes positive emotions, reduces negative emotions and helps 
        individuals to hone their virtues of character.
        It's a tool set that helps us direct our thoughts and actions in an unpredictable world. We 
        don’t control and cannot rely on external events, but we can (to a certain extent) control our mind 
        and choose our behavior.
        In the end, it’s not what happens to us but our reactions to it that matter.

                Did you ever notice that people speak primarily about themselves? Even if they ask questions, 
                as soon as they see the chance, they jump in and talk about something related to them. Whatever 
                the topic, they will find something from their own life to add to the conversation. That’s what 
                we do. We like to talk about ourselves. The problem with that? We don’t listen with the intention
                 to understand but we prepare what we want to say next. <br>
                 The Stoic mindset to adopt here is twofold: <br>
                 (1) Don’t gossip. Don’t blame. Don’t complain. Don’t talk too much. Especially not about 
                 what’s not meaningful. <br>
                 (2) Listen instead. Listen with the intention to understand what the other person is trying to say.

                forth. The Stoics want to stay calm even in the midst of a storm, and yet we go crazy when our 
                roomie forgets to do the dishes, leaves skid marks behind in the toilet, or doesn’t do his

                Difficult situations in life are only obstacles if we make them so. It depends on how we look at
                 those challenges—we can either see obstacles and get blocked, or we can see opportunities and 
                 make progress. This all comes down to our perception. The same situation can either be perceived 
                 as a lead ball chained to your feet or as wings growing out of your shoulder blades. How you 
                 interpret the challenge is crucial to your success of overcoming it. Ultimately, it’s never the 
                 challenges that matter, but what you do with them. And hey, this isn’t about wearing rose-tinted 
                 glasses. Terrible things happen, that’s sure. This is just showing that you always have a choice. 
                 Either you bury your head in the sand when things seem to turn against you, or you keep your head 
                 up and see it as an opportunity for growth. Your choice.

                Anger is a passion, a negative emotion the Stoics wanted to minimize. Anger, the desire to repay
                 suffering, is brief madness, says Seneca. Because an angry man lacks self-control, is forgetful
                  of kinship, deaf to reason and advice, gets aroused by trifles, and doesn’t know what’s true and 
                  false—“very like a falling rock which breaks itself to pieces upon the very thing which it 
                  crushes.” Getting angry hurts yourself the most.

                Think of different life situations as hands you were dealt like in poker. The hands are dealt 
                by chance; you have no say in what you’ll get. Basically, these life situations are neutral. 
                What matters now is how well you play them. It’s all you control. An admirable player tries to 
                play their given hands the best they can. And then accept the outcome calmly, focus on what 
                they control, and then play on. In the end, it’s not the given cards that matter, but what you 
                do with them. You don’t control all that happens to you in life, but you have the power to 
                choose what to do with the given situations.

                know what will be the consequences of good fortune. We can’t change what already is. Therefore

                “When force of circumstance upsets your equanimity, lose no time in recovering your 
                self-control, and do not remain out of tune longer than you can help. Habitual recurrence
                 to the harmony will increase your mastery of it.” – Marcus Aurelius

                We all get caught off guard from time to time. Not just by major events, but also by minor, often unexpected 
                occurrences. The train doesn’t arrive on time, your bike gets stolen, your friend cancels the
                 date at the last minute. It’s in weak moments when such insignificant situations can knock us 
                 out. We lose balance and become irritable and grouchy. Look, there’s no problem in getting 
                 thrown out of balance sometimes, it happens to all of us. As a Stoic student, you know this. 
                 Your main goal is to recover as quickly as possible. Like a punching ball that rebounds 
                 whenever you hit it. The most important: Get back to balance as soon as possible. Don’t be 
                 knocked out any longer than necessary. Get a hold on yourself and get back up! Return to
                  balance. <br>
                Modern philosopher Brian Johnson calls this the Equanimity Game. The rules are simple: <br>
                (1) notice when you’re off-balance, then <br>
                (2) see how fast you can catch yourself and correct yourself—bringing yourself back to equanimity.

      <h2 class="mitte">The Dunning Kruger Effect</h2>
      <p class="justify">The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people wrongly overestimate 
        their knowledge or ability in a specific area. This tends to occur because a lack of 
        self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their own skills.</p>
        <p class="justify">The opposite of the Dunning Kruger Effect is the Imposter Syndrome, where people are plagued
           by self-doubts and constantly feel like frauds who will be unmasked any second.</p>
        <p class="bold collapseListHeader" data-bs-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" role="button" aria-controls="dunning1" href="#dunning1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-chevron-right" viewBox="0 0 16 16"></svg>What causes the Dunning Kruger Effect?</p>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="dunning1">
          <p class="justify">Confidence is so highly prized that many people would rather pretend to be smart or skilled than 
          risk looking inadequate and losing face. Even smart people can be affected by the Dunning-Kruger 
          effect because having intelligence isn’t the same thing as learning and developing a specific skill. 
          Many individuals mistakenly believe that their experience and skills in one particular area are 
          transferable to another.</p>
          <p class="justify">Many people would describe themselves as above average in intelligence, humor, 
            and a variety of skills. They can’t accurately judge their own competence, because they lack 
            metacognition, or the ability to step back and examine oneself objectively. In fact, those who are 
            the least skilled are also the most likely to overestimate their abilities.</p>
            <p class="justify">The Dunning-Kruger effect results in what’s known as a "double curse:" Not only 
              do people perform poorly, but they are not self-aware enough to judge themselves accurately—and

                      ignored or discounted them? You may have experienced the Dunning-Kruger effect. Take a 
                      look at those areas in your life where you feel 100 percent confident. Acknowledge the 
                      possibility that you might not always be right, and you might need to acquire knowledge

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse1">
          <p class="justify">
            This fallacy occurs when your opponent over-simplifies or
            misrepresents your argument (i.e., setting up a "straw man") to make
            it easier to attack or refute. Instead of fully addressing your
            actual argument, speakers relying on this fallacy present a
            superficially similar -- but ultimately not equal -- version of your
            real stance, helping them create the illusion of easily defeating
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />John: I think we should hire someone to redesign our
            website. <br />
            Lola: You're saying we should throw our money away on external
            resources instead of building up our in-house design team? That's
            going to hurt our company in the long run.

        </svg>The Bandwagon Fallacy</li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse2">
          <p class="justify">
            Just because a significant population of people believe a
            proposition is true, doesn't automatically make it true. Popularity
            alone is not enough to validate an argument, though it's often used
            as a standalone justification of validity. Arguments in this style
            don't take into account whether or not the population validating the
            argument is actually qualified to do so, or if contrary evidence
            exists. While most of us expect to see bandwagon arguments in
            advertising (e.g., "three out of four people think X brand
            toothpaste cleans teeth best"), this fallacy can easily sneak it's
            way into everyday meetings and conversations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            The majority of people believe advertisers should spend more money
            on billboards, so billboards are objectively the best form of
            advertisement.

        </li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse3">
          <p class="justify">
            While appeals to authority are by no means always fallacious, they
            can quickly become dangerous when you rely too heavily on the
            opinion of a single person -- especially if that person is
            attempting to validate something outside of their expertise. Getting
            an authority figure to back your proposition can be a powerful
            addition to an existing argument, but it can't be the pillar your
            entire argument rests on. Just because someone in a position of
            power believes something to be true, doesn't make it true.
          </p>

            Example: <br />
            Despite the fact that our Q4 numbers are much lower than usual, we

        </li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse4">
          <p class="justify">
            This common fallacy misleads by presenting complex issues in terms
            of two inherently opposed sides. Instead of acknowledging that most
            (if not all) issues can be thought of on a spectrum of possibilities
            and stances, the false dilemma fallacy asserts that there are only
            two mutually exclusive outcomes. This fallacy is particularly
            problematic because it can lend false credence to extreme stances,
            ignoring opportunities for compromise or chances to re-frame the
            issue in a new way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse5">
          <p class="justify">
            This fallacy occurs when someone draws expansive conclusions based
            on inadequate or insufficient evidence. In other words, they jump to
            conclusions about the validity of a proposition with some -- but not
            enough -- evidence to back it up, and overlook potential
            counterarguments.

          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Two members of my team have become more engaged employees after
            taking public speaking classes. That proves we should have mandatory

            engagement.

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse6">
          <p class="justify">
            Slothful induction is the exact inverse of the hasty generalization
            fallacy above. This fallacy occurs when sufficient logical evidence
            strongly indicates a particular conclusion is true, but someone
            fails to acknowledge it, instead attributing the outcome to
            coincidence or something unrelated entirely.

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse7">
          <p class="justify">
            If two things appear to be correlated, this doesn't necessarily
            indicate that one of those things irrefutably caused the other
            thing. This might seem like an obvious fallacy to spot, but it can
            be challenging to catch in practice -- particularly when you really
            want to find a correlation between two points of data to prove your
            point.

            Example: <br />
            Our blog views were down in April. We also changed the color of our

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse8">
          <p class="justify">
            In place of logical evidence, this fallacy substitutes examples from
            someone's personal experience. Arguments that rely heavily on
            anecdotal evidence tend to overlook the fact that one (possibly
            isolated) example can't stand alone as definitive proof of a greater
            premise.

            Example: <br />
            One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse9">
          <p class="justify">
            This fallacy gets its colorful name from an anecdote about a Texan
            who fires his gun at a barn wall, and then proceeds to paint a
            target around the closest cluster of bullet holes. He then points at
            the bullet-riddled target as evidence of his expert marksmanship.
            Speakers who rely on the Texas sharpshooter fallacy tend to
            cherry-pick data clusters based on a predetermined conclusion.
            Instead of letting a full spectrum of evidence lead them to a
            logical conclusion, they find patterns and correlations in support
            of their goals, and ignore evidence that contradicts them or
            suggests the clusters weren't actually statistically significant.

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse10">
          <p class="justify">
            This fallacy assumes that a compromise between two extreme
            conflicting points is always true. Arguments of this style ignore
            the possibility that one or both of the extremes could be completely
            true or false -- rendering any form of compromise between the two
            invalid as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Lola thinks the best way to improve conversions is to redesign the
            entire company website, but John is firmly against making any

            If a person claims that X is true, it is their responsibility to
            provide evidence in support of that assertion. It is invalid to
            claim that X is true until someone else can prove that X is not
            true. Similarly, it is also invalid to claim that X is true because
            it's impossible to prove that X is false. In other words, just
            because there is no evidence presented against something, that
            doesn't automatically make that thing true.

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse13">
          <p class="justify">
            Often used to protect assertions that rely on universal
            generalizations (like "all Marketers love pie") this fallacy
            inaccurately deflects counterexamples to a claim by changing the
            positioning or conditions of the original claim to exclude the
            counterexample. In other words, instead of acknolwedging that a
            counterexample to their original claim exists, the speaker ammends
            the terms of the claim. In the example below, when Barabara presents
            a valid counterexample to John's claim, John changes the terms of
            his claim to exclude Barbara's counterexample.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            John: No marketer would ever put two call-to-actions on a single
            landing page. <br />

            Barbara: Lola, a marketer, actually found great success putting two
            call-to-actions on a single landing page for our last campaign.
            <br />

            John: Well, no true marketer would put two call-to-actions on a
            single landing page, so Lola must not be a true marketer.

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse14">
          <p class="justify">
            The tu quoque fallacy (Latin for "you also") is an invalid attempt
            to discredit an opponent by answering criticism with criticism --
            but never actually presenting a counterargument to the original
            disputed claim. In the example below, Lola makes a claim. Instead of
            presenting evidence against Lola's claim, John levels a claim
            against Lola. This attack doesn't actually help John succeed in
            proving Lola wrong, since he doesn't address her original claim in
            any capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Lola: I don't think John would be a good fit to manage this project,
            because he doesn't have a lot of experience with project management.
            <br />
            John: But you don't have a lot of experience in project management

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse15">
          <p class="justify">
            Here's something vital to keep in mind when sniffing out fallacies:
            just because someone's argument relies on a fallacy doesn't
            necessarily mean that their claim is inherently untrue. Making a
            fallacy-riddled claim doesn't automatically invalidate the premise
            of the argument -- it just means the argument doesn't actually
            validate their premise. In other words, their argument sucks, but
            they aren't necessarily wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            John's argument in favor of redesigning the company website clearly
            relied heavily on cherry-picked statistics in support of his claim,
            so Lola decided that redesigning the website must not be a good
            decision.

      <h3>The Truth About “Mind Reading”</h3>
      <p>
        Barnum Statements are also known as Assimilation Bias or the Self
        Reference Phenomenon
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="bold">How it began</p>
          <p class="justify">
            1940's. Behavioral psychologist Bertram R Forer got 39 students
            together and gave them a personality test. Some weeks later he
            provided them each with a profile. He didn’t tell them they’d all
            been given the same personality profile. They thought the profiles
            were individualized based on the personality test. In fact, Forer
            had copied most of the profile’s content from an astrology book! He
            then asked them to check how accurate they thought their
            ‘individual’ profiles were. They gave a score of 4.3 out of 5 on
            average, which equates to a whopping 85.2% satisfaction rate. The
            test subjects were ready and willing to accept generalized
            descriptions of their personality as long as they would fit into
            their world view and belief system. <br />
            Conclusion: People will believe that certain vague statements fit
            their personality if they are vague enough.

              While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able

            <li>Your sexual adjustment has presented problems for you.</li>
            <li>
              Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome

            </li>
            <li>
              At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the

            <li>
              You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept

            </li>
            <li>
              You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to
              others.

            <li>
              At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other
              times you are introverted, wary, reserved.

            These are “truisms” that apply to almost everyone. You fit these
            statements to yourself. However, Barnum Statements always involve
            very “personal” aspects of the target. This way, they feel
            personalized to the person that you want to deliver to.

              Instead, use words that can be interpreted in different ways, such
              as: sometimes, somewhat, now and then, often, at times.

            <li>sound 100% convincing</li>
            <p>
              To sound convincing, you’ve got to BE convincing. If you believe
              in what you’re saying you’ll give off a confident, trustworthy
              vibe. When someone disagrees with a Barnum Statement: Move on to
              the next Barnum Statement quickly. Don’t explain yourself. Just
              keep plowing!
