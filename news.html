        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse1">
          <p class="justify">
            This fallacy occurs when your opponent over-simplifies or
            misrepresents your argument (i.e., setting up a "straw man") to make
            it easier to attack or refute. Instead of fully addressing your
            actual argument, speakers relying on this fallacy present a
            superficially similar -- but ultimately not equal -- version of your
            real stance, helping them create the illusion of easily defeating
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />John: I think we should hire someone to redesign our
            website. <br />
            Lola: You're saying we should throw our money away on external
            resources instead of building up our in-house design team? That's
            going to hurt our company in the long run.

        </svg>The Bandwagon Fallacy</li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse2">
          <p class="justify">
            Just because a significant population of people believe a
            proposition is true, doesn't automatically make it true. Popularity
            alone is not enough to validate an argument, though it's often used
            as a standalone justification of validity. Arguments in this style
            don't take into account whether or not the population validating the
            argument is actually qualified to do so, or if contrary evidence
            exists. While most of us expect to see bandwagon arguments in
            advertising (e.g., "three out of four people think X brand
            toothpaste cleans teeth best"), this fallacy can easily sneak it's
            way into everyday meetings and conversations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            The majority of people believe advertisers should spend more money
            on billboards, so billboards are objectively the best form of
            advertisement.

          </svg>The Appeal to Authority Fallacy
        </li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse3">
          <p class="justify">
            While appeals to authority are by no means always fallacious, they
            can quickly become dangerous when you rely too heavily on the
            opinion of a single person -- especially if that person is
            attempting to validate something outside of their expertise. Getting
            an authority figure to back your proposition can be a powerful
            addition to an existing argument, but it can't be the pillar your
            entire argument rests on. Just because someone in a position of
            power believes something to be true, doesn't make it true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Despite the fact that our Q4 numbers are much lower than usual, we
            should push forward using the same strategy because our CEO Barbara
            says this is the best approach.

          </svg>The False Dilemma Fallacy
        </li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse4">
          <p class="justify">
            This common fallacy misleads by presenting complex issues in terms
            of two inherently opposed sides. Instead of acknowledging that most
            (if not all) issues can be thought of on a spectrum of possibilities
            and stances, the false dilemma fallacy asserts that there are only
            two mutually exclusive outcomes. This fallacy is particularly
            problematic because it can lend false credence to extreme stances,
            ignoring opportunities for compromise or chances to re-frame the
            issue in a new way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            We can either agree with Barbara's plan, or just let the project
            fail. There is no other option.

        </li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse5">
          <p class="justify">
            This fallacy occurs when someone draws expansive conclusions based
            on inadequate or insufficient evidence. In other words, they jump to
            conclusions about the validity of a proposition with some -- but not
            enough -- evidence to back it up, and overlook potential
            counterarguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Two members of my team have become more engaged employees after
            taking public speaking classes. That proves we should have mandatory
            public speaking classes for the whole company to improve employee
            engagement.

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse6">
          <p class="justify">
            Slothful induction is the exact inverse of the hasty generalization
            fallacy above. This fallacy occurs when sufficient logical evidence
            strongly indicates a particular conclusion is true, but someone
            fails to acknowledge it, instead attributing the outcome to
            coincidence or something unrelated entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Even though every project Brad has managed in the last two years has
            run way behind schedule, I still think we can chalk it up to
            unfortunate circumstances, not his project management skills.

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse7">
          <p class="justify">
            If two things appear to be correlated, this doesn't necessarily
            indicate that one of those things irrefutably caused the other
            thing. This might seem like an obvious fallacy to spot, but it can
            be challenging to catch in practice -- particularly when you really
            want to find a correlation between two points of data to prove your
            point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Our blog views were down in April. We also changed the color of our
            blog header in April. This means that changing the color of the blog
            header led to less views in April.

        </li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse8">
          <p class="justify">
            In place of logical evidence, this fallacy substitutes examples from
            someone's personal experience. Arguments that rely heavily on
            anecdotal evidence tend to overlook the fact that one (possibly
            isolated) example can't stand alone as definitive proof of a greater
            premise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all
            their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text
            to red is a proven way to double conversions.

          </svg>The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy
        </li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse9">
          <p class="justify">
            This fallacy gets its colorful name from an anecdote about a Texan
            who fires his gun at a barn wall, and then proceeds to paint a
            target around the closest cluster of bullet holes. He then points at
            the bullet-riddled target as evidence of his expert marksmanship.
            Speakers who rely on the Texas sharpshooter fallacy tend to
            cherry-pick data clusters based on a predetermined conclusion.
            Instead of letting a full spectrum of evidence lead them to a
            logical conclusion, they find patterns and correlations in support
            of their goals, and ignore evidence that contradicts them or
            suggests the clusters weren't actually statistically significant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Lisa sold her first startup to an influential tech company, so she
            must be a successful entrepreneur. (She ignores the fact that four
            of her startups have failed since then.)

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse10">
          <p class="justify">
            This fallacy assumes that a compromise between two extreme
            conflicting points is always true. Arguments of this style ignore
            the possibility that one or both of the extremes could be completely
            true or false -- rendering any form of compromise between the two
            invalid as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Lola thinks the best way to improve conversions is to redesign the
            entire company website, but John is firmly against making any
            changes to the website. Therefore, the best approach is to redesign
            some portions of the website.

            If a person claims that X is true, it is their responsibility to

            claim that X is true until someone else can prove that X is not
            true. Similarly, it is also invalid to claim that X is true because
            it's impossible to prove that X is false. In other words, just
            because there is no evidence presented against something, that
            doesn't automatically make that thing true.

          </svg>The "No True Scotsman" Fallacy
        </li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse13">
          <p class="justify">
            Often used to protect assertions that rely on universal
            generalizations (like "all Marketers love pie") this fallacy
            inaccurately deflects counterexamples to a claim by changing the
            positioning or conditions of the original claim to exclude the
            counterexample. In other words, instead of acknolwedging that a
            counterexample to their original claim exists, the speaker ammends
            the terms of the claim. In the example below, when Barabara presents
            a valid counterexample to John's claim, John changes the terms of
            his claim to exclude Barbara's counterexample.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            John: No marketer would ever put two call-to-actions on a single
            landing page. <br />

            Barbara: Lola, a marketer, actually found great success putting two
            call-to-actions on a single landing page for our last campaign.
            <br />

            John: Well, no true marketer would put two call-to-actions on a
            single landing page, so Lola must not be a true marketer.

        </svg>The  Tu quoque Fallacy</li>
        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse14">
          <p class="justify">
            The tu quoque fallacy (Latin for "you also") is an invalid attempt
            to discredit an opponent by answering criticism with criticism --
            but never actually presenting a counterargument to the original
            disputed claim. In the example below, Lola makes a claim. Instead of
            presenting evidence against Lola's claim, John levels a claim
            against Lola. This attack doesn't actually help John succeed in
            proving Lola wrong, since he doesn't address her original claim in
            any capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            Lola: I don't think John would be a good fit to manage this project,
            because he doesn't have a lot of experience with project management.
            <br />
            John: But you don't have a lot of experience in project management
            either!

        <div class="collapseListItem collapse" id="collapse15">
          <p class="justify">
            Here's something vital to keep in mind when sniffing out fallacies:
            just because someone's argument relies on a fallacy doesn't
            necessarily mean that their claim is inherently untrue. Making a
            fallacy-riddled claim doesn't automatically invalidate the premise
            of the argument -- it just means the argument doesn't actually
            validate their premise. In other words, their argument sucks, but
            they aren't necessarily wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <br />
            John's argument in favor of redesigning the company website clearly
            relied heavily on cherry-picked statistics in support of his claim,
            so Lola decided that redesigning the website must not be a good
            decision.

      <h3>The Truth About “Mind Reading”</h3>
      <p>
        Barnum Statements are also known as Assimilation Bias or the Self
        Reference Phenomenon
      </p>

        <li>
          <p class="bold">How it began</p>
          <p class="justify">
            1940's. Behavioral psychologist Bertram R Forer got 39 students
            together and gave them a personality test. Some weeks later he
            provided them each with a profile. He didn’t tell them they’d all
            been given the same personality profile. They thought the profiles
            were individualized based on the personality test. In fact, Forer
            had copied most of the profile’s content from an astrology book! He
            then asked them to check how accurate they thought their
            ‘individual’ profiles were. They gave a score of 4.3 out of 5 on
            average, which equates to a whopping 85.2% satisfaction rate. The
            test subjects were ready and willing to accept generalized
            descriptions of their personality as long as they would fit into
            their world view and belief system. <br />
            Conclusion: People will believe that certain vague statements fit
            their personality if they are vague enough.

            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able
              to compensate for them.
            </li>
            <li>Your sexual adjustment has presented problems for you.</li>
            <li>
              Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome
              and insecure inside.
            </li>
            <li>
              At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the
              right decision or done the right thing.
            </li>
            <li>
              You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become

            <li>
              You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept
              others' statements without satisfactory proof.
            </li>
            <li>
              You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to
              others.
            </li>
            <li>
              At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other
              times you are introverted, wary, reserved.

            <li>Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.</li>

            These are “truisms” that apply to almost everyone. You fit these
            statements to yourself. However, Barnum Statements always involve
            very “personal” aspects of the target. This way, they feel
            personalized to the person that you want to deliver to.

              Instead, use words that can be interpreted in different ways, such
              as: sometimes, somewhat, now and then, often, at times.

            <li>sound 100% convincing</li>
            <p>
              To sound convincing, you’ve got to BE convincing. If you believe
              in what you’re saying you’ll give off a confident, trustworthy
              vibe. When someone disagrees with a Barnum Statement: Move on to
              the next Barnum Statement quickly. Don’t explain yourself. Just
              keep plowing!
